A Student Portal Demo is a sample version of an online platform designed for students to manage their academic activities. It’s usually created to show how the actual student portal works—either for testing, presentation, training, or development purposes.

A student portal is a secure website where students can:

View their grades and transcripts

Register for courses

Access schedules and calendars

Communicate with teachers and classmates

Submit assignments or view materials

Pay fees and check account balances
